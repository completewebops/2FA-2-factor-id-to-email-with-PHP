Simple 2 factor email validation app

Requires sendgrid by Twilio and an account with them 
https://sendgrid.com/ and you will need to set up an API key in a project to use for this endpoint. (easy)

Requires Sql (or similar) Database

Requires composer for the easy twilo/sendgrid files add in. Also availible on github.
With composer you can add the code with :

composer require sendgrid/sendgrid

Place in the correct folder in the terminal. Although with this repository you don't need to do that as I have included the files.

I currently have the API key hard coded, well an example to help the beginner. Clear documentation in the files used.
